# Circle of Competence Assessment

Evaluate whether an opportunity, decision, or investment falls within your area of genuine understanding—and guide appropriate action based on that assessment.

---

## When to Use

- Considering an investment or business opportunity
- Facing a decision in an unfamiliar domain
- Tempted by something that seems attractive but complex
- Request for "Do I understand this well enough?"
- Evaluating whether to act, learn more, or abstain

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| opportunity | Yes | Description of the opportunity, investment, or decision |
| your_background | No | Your relevant knowledge, experience, and expertise |
| complexity_level | No | How complex or specialized the domain appears |

---

## The Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Define What Understanding Means

Identify what you would need to know to make a sound decision:
- What are the key drivers of success or failure?
- What variables matter most to the outcome?
- What could go wrong, and would you recognize it early?
- What do experts in this domain know that you don't?

**Buffett's insight:** "Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing."

### Step 2: Honestly Assess Your Knowledge

Evaluate your actual understanding against requirements:

**Inside the circle:**
- You can explain the business/situation to someone else clearly
- You understand how it makes money (or succeeds)
- You can identify what would cause it to fail
- You have relevant experience or deep study
- You could reasonably predict behavior in different scenarios

**At the boundary:**
- You understand the basics but have gaps
- You know the key questions but not all the answers
- You could learn what you need with reasonable effort
- You recognize your blind spots

**Outside the circle:**
- You're relying on others' opinions without independent judgment
- You can't explain the fundamentals simply
- You wouldn't recognize a red flag if you saw one
- The domain requires specialized knowledge you lack
- You're attracted by potential return, not understanding

**Buffett's insight:** "You don't have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."

### Step 3: Assess the Cost of Being Wrong

Evaluate the stakes:
- What do you lose if your assessment is wrong?
- Is this a reversible or irreversible decision?
- How much is at risk relative to your total resources?
- Are there limited-downside ways to participate?

**Key question:** Can you afford to be wrong here, given how well you understand it?

### Step 4: Determine Appropriate Action

Based on your assessment:

**If INSIDE the circle:**
- Proceed with analysis and potential action
- Apply your expertise to evaluate fully
- Trust your judgment on the fundamentals

**If AT THE BOUNDARY:**
- Consider whether the opportunity justifies the learning investment
- Identify specific knowledge gaps and how to fill them
- Seek trusted expertise to complement your understanding
- Reduce position size to reflect uncertainty

**If OUTSIDE the circle:**
- Acknowledge limits honestly: "I don't understand this well enough"
- Either commit to genuine learning (months/years, not days)
- Or abstain entirely—no shame in passing
- Remember: there will always be another opportunity inside your circle

**Buffett's insight:** "What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know."

- **Reversibility:** [Can you exit if wrong?]
- **Proportionality:** [Size relative to your resources]

### Recommended Action
**Decision:** [Act / Learn then act / Abstain]
**Rationale:** [Why this is the appropriate response]
**If learning:** [Specific steps to expand competence]
**If abstaining:** [Reframe as discipline, not loss]
```

## Constraints

- Be ruthlessly honest about knowledge gaps
- Don't confuse familiarity with understanding
- Don't let fear of missing out override honest assessment
- Don't assume understanding can be quickly acquired in complex domains
- Respect that "I don't know" is a valid and valuable answer

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails | Instead Do |
|--------------|--------------|------------|
| **FOMO-driven analysis** | Fear of missing out overrides honest assessment; you convince yourself you understand enough | Start with honest "what would I need to know?" before evaluating the opportunity's attractiveness |
| **Secondhand confidence** | Trusting others' excitement ("my friend says it's great") as substitute for your own understanding | Distinguish access from insight; knowing someone in a domain doesn't mean you understand the domain |
| **Confusing familiarity with competence** | Using products/services makes you feel you understand the business | Ask: "Could I predict how this business would perform in different scenarios?" |
| **Complexity denial** | Assuming complex domains can be quickly learned ("I'll figure it out") | Acknowledge that genuine competence in specialized domains takes years, not weeks |
| **Boundary blindness** | Not knowing where your knowledge ends; overestimating reach | Force yourself to articulate specific gaps before claiming understanding |

## Example 1: Biotech Investment

**Input:** "My friend works at a biotech startup developing a new cancer treatment. They're raising a seed round and offering me a chance to invest. The science sounds promising."

**Output:**

## Circle of Competence Assessment

### Opportunity Summary
Early-stage investment in a biotech startup developing cancer treatment technology.

### Knowledge Requirements
| Domain Knowledge | Required Understanding | Why It Matters |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Cancer biology | Mechanism of action, competitive landscape | Determines if science is differentiated |
| Drug development | FDA approval process, trial design, timelines | 90%+ of drugs fail; why would this succeed? |
| Biotech financing | Dilution, runway, next round dynamics | Determines if you'll be protected or washed out |
| Competitive analysis | What else is in development for this indication | First mover vs. fast follower dynamics |
| Management quality | Track record in drug development | Execution matters enormously in biotech |

### Your Competence Assessment
| Knowledge Area | Your Level | Evidence | Gaps |
|----------------|------------|----------|------|
| Cancer biology | Outside | No training; can't evaluate mechanism | Cannot assess if science is sound |
| Drug development | Outside | Never invested in biotech | Don't know what success signals look like |
| Biotech financing | Boundary | Understand seed rounds generally | Don't know biotech-specific structures |
| Competitive analysis | Outside | Can't evaluate scientific differentiation | Don't know what's in competitor pipelines |
| Management quality | Boundary | Can assess general leadership | Can't evaluate scientific credibility |

### Overall Assessment
**Position:** Outside the circle
**Confidence:** High
**Key reasoning:** Four of five critical knowledge areas are completely outside my competence. I cannot independently evaluate whether the science is promising—I can only take my friend's word for it.

### Risk Assessment
- **Downside if wrong:** Total loss of investment (typical for biotech)
- **Reversibility:** No—private investment is illiquid
- **Proportionality:** [Depends on amount, but early biotech is binary]

### Recommended Action
**Decision:** Abstain
**Rationale:** "The science sounds promising" is exactly the kind of secondhand opinion that Buffett warns against. I have no way to evaluate the core value proposition. Being friends with an employee provides access, not insight. The domain requires years of specialized knowledge I don't have.

**Reframe:** This isn't a missed opportunity—it's an opportunity I was never qualified to evaluate. There will be opportunities inside my circle. My friend's success or failure will tell me nothing about whether my decision was correct.

## Example 2: Consumer Retail Investment

**Input:** "I've shopped at Costco for 20 years and love the company. Should I invest in the stock?"

**Output:**

## Circle of Competence Assessment

### Opportunity Summary
Public equity investment in Costco Wholesale Corporation, a membership warehouse retailer.

### Knowledge Requirements
| Domain Knowledge | Required Understanding | Why It Matters |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Retail operations | Membership model, inventory turns, supplier relationships | Core business mechanics |
| Competitive positioning | Walmart, Amazon, Target dynamics | Moat durability |
| Financial analysis | Revenue per square foot, membership renewal rates, margins | Valuation basis |
| Consumer behavior | Why members stay loyal, pricing perception | Revenue predictability |
| Real estate strategy | Owned vs. leased, location selection | Asset value and expansion |

### Your Competence Assessment
| Knowledge Area | Your Level | Evidence | Gaps |
|----------------|------------|----------|------|
| Retail operations | Boundary | Understand customer experience; see inventory management in action | Don't know supplier contracts or regional variation |
| Competitive positioning | Inside | Shop at competitors too; understand value proposition differences | Limited view on B2B/international |
| Financial analysis | Boundary | Can read 10-K; understand membership metrics | Need deeper analysis of comparable valuations |
| Consumer behavior | Inside | 20 years observing my own and others' behavior; understand the psychology | Anecdotal, not systematic |
| Real estate strategy | Outside | Know my local stores; no visibility into acquisition strategy | Significant gap |

### Overall Assessment
**Position:** At the Boundary
**Confidence:** Medium
**Key reasoning:** Long experience as customer provides genuine insight into value proposition and customer loyalty. Can understand core business model. Gaps exist in financial valuation and real estate strategy, but these are learnable with standard investor research.

### Risk Assessment
- **Downside if wrong:** Public equity is liquid; can exit
- **Reversibility:** High—can sell at market price any time
- **Proportionality:** Position sizing can reflect uncertainty

### Recommended Action
**Decision:** Learn then act
**Rationale:** Customer insight is valuable but insufficient. Need to complement with financial analysis. The domain is accessible with standard investment research—not requiring years of specialized training.

**Learning path:**
1. Read last 3 annual reports and investor presentations
2. Study membership renewal trends and comparable valuations
3. Understand margin structure compared to Walmart and Target
4. Size position modestly given remaining gaps

**Key insight:** Being a devoted customer provides genuine edge in understanding value proposition and competitive moat—but doesn't replace financial analysis. This is different from biotech: the domain IS accessible with reasonable study.
