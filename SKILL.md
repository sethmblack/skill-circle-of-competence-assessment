# Circle of Competence Assessment

Evaluate whether an opportunity, decision, or investment falls within your area of genuine understanding—and guide appropriate action based on that assessment.

---

## When to Use

- Considering an investment or business opportunity
- Facing a decision in an unfamiliar domain
- Tempted by something that seems attractive but complex
- Request for "Do I understand this well enough?"
- Evaluating whether to act, learn more, or abstain

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| opportunity | Yes | Description of the opportunity, investment, or decision |
| your_background | No | Your relevant knowledge, experience, and expertise |
| complexity_level | No | How complex or specialized the domain appears |

---

## The Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Define What Understanding Means

Identify what you would need to know to make a sound decision:
- What are the key drivers of success or failure?
- What variables matter most to the outcome?
- What could go wrong, and would you recognize it early?
- What do experts in this domain know that you don't?

**Buffett's insight:** "Risk comes from not knowing what you're doing."

### Step 2: Honestly Assess Your Knowledge

Evaluate your actual understanding against requirements:

**Inside the circle:**
- You can explain the business/situation to someone else clearly
- You understand how it makes money (or succeeds)
- You can identify what would cause it to fail
- You have relevant experience or deep study
- You could reasonably predict behavior in different scenarios

**At the boundary:**
- You understand the basics but have gaps
- You know the key questions but not all the answers
- You could learn what you need with reasonable effort
- You recognize your blind spots

**Outside the circle:**
- You're relying on others' opinions without independent judgment
- You can't explain the fundamentals simply
- You wouldn't recognize a red flag if you saw one
- The domain requires specialized knowledge you lack
- You're attracted by potential return, not understanding

**Buffett's insight:** "You don't have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."

### Step 3: Assess the Cost of Being Wrong

Evaluate the stakes:
- What do you lose if your assessment is wrong?
- Is this a reversible or irreversible decision?
- How much is at risk relative to your total resources?
- Are there limited-downside ways to participate?

**Key question:** Can you afford to be wrong here, given how well you understand it?

### Step 4: Determine Appropriate Action

Based on your assessment:

**If INSIDE the circle:**
- Proceed with analysis and potential action
- Apply your expertise to evaluate fully
- Trust your judgment on the fundamentals

**If AT THE BOUNDARY:**
- Consider whether the opportunity justifies the learning investment
- Identify specific knowledge gaps and how to fill them
- Seek trusted expertise to complement your understanding
- Reduce position size to reflect uncertainty

**If OUTSIDE the circle:**
- Acknowledge limits honestly: "I don't understand this well enough"
- Either commit to genuine learning (months/years, not days)
- Or abstain entirely—no shame in passing
- Remember: there will always be another opportunity inside your circle

**Buffett's insight:** "What counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don't know."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Circle of Competence Assessment

### Opportunity Summary
[1-2 sentence description of what's being evaluated]

### Knowledge Requirements
| Domain Knowledge | Required Understanding | Why It Matters |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| [Area 1] | [What you'd need to know] | [How it affects outcome] |
| [Area 2] | ... | ... |

### Your Competence Assessment
| Knowledge Area | Your Level | Evidence | Gaps |
|----------------|------------|----------|------|
| [Area 1] | Inside/Boundary/Outside | [Specific evidence] | [Specific gaps] |
| [Area 2] | ... | ... | ... |

### Overall Assessment
**Position:** [Inside / At Boundary / Outside]
**Confidence:** [High / Medium / Low]
**Key reasoning:** [Why this assessment]

### Risk Assessment
- **Downside if wrong:** [What you could lose]
- **Reversibility:** [Can you exit if wrong?]
- **Proportionality:** [Size relative to your resources]

### Recommended Action
**Decision:** [Act / Learn then act / Abstain]
**Rationale:** [Why this is the appropriate response]
**If learning:** [Specific steps to expand competence]
**If abstaining:** [Reframe as discipline, not loss]
```

## Constraints

- Be ruthlessly honest about knowledge gaps
- Don't confuse familiarity with understanding
- Don't let fear of missing out override honest assessment
- Don't assume understanding can be quickly acquired in complex domains
- Respect that "I don't know" is a valid and valuable answer

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "My friend works at a biotech startup developing a new cancer treatment. They're raising a seed round and offering me a chance to invest. The science sounds promising."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Circle of Competence Assessment

### Opportunity Summary
Early-stage investment in a biotech startup developing cancer treatment technology.

### Knowledge Requirements
| Domain Knowledge | Required Understanding | Why It Matters |
|------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Cancer biology | Mechanism of action, competitive landscape | Determines if science is differentiated |
| Drug development | FDA approval process, trial design, timelines | 90%+ of drugs fail; why would this succeed? |
| Biotech financing | Dilution, runway, next round dynamics | Determines if you'll be protected or washed out |
| Competitive analysis | What else is in development for this indication | First mover vs. fast follower dynamics |
| Management quality | Track record in drug development | Execution matters enormously in biotech |

### Your Competence Assessment
| Knowledge Area | Your Level | Evidence | Gaps |
|----------------|------------|----------|------|
| Cancer biology | Outside | No training; can't evaluate mechanism | Cannot assess if science is sound |
| Drug development | Outside | Never invested in biotech | Don't know what success signals look like |
| Biotech financing | Boundary | Understand seed rounds generally | Don't know biotech-specific structures |
| Competitive analysis | Outside | Can't evaluate scientific differentiation | Don't know what's in competitor pipelines |
| Management quality | Boundary | Can assess general leadership | Can't evaluate scientific credibility |

### Overall Assessment
**Position:** Outside the circle
**Confidence:** High
**Key reasoning:** Four of five critical knowledge areas are completely outside my competence. I cannot independently evaluate whether the science is promising—I can only take my friend's word for it.

### Risk Assessment
- **Downside if wrong:** Total loss of investment (typical for biotech)
- **Reversibility:** No—private investment is illiquid
- **Proportionality:** [Depends on amount, but early biotech is binary]

### Recommended Action
**Decision:** Abstain
**Rationale:** "The science sounds promising" is exactly the kind of secondhand opinion that Buffett warns against. I have no way to evaluate the core value proposition. Being friends with an employee provides access, not insight. The domain requires years of specialized knowledge I don't have.

**Reframe:** This isn't a missed opportunity—it's an opportunity I was never qualified to evaluate. There will be opportunities inside my circle. My friend's success or failure will tell me nothing about whether my decision was correct.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Warren Buffett** expert persona. Use it as the first filter for any significant opportunity—knowing when to pass is just as valuable as knowing when to act.
